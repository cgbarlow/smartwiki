- Modern features
- **Total cost at 100K users**: $1,000+/month

### Migration Strategy

1. **Phase 1**: Implement WorkOS AuthKit for basic authentication
2. **Phase 2**: Add Supabase for database with RLS for multi-tenancy
3. **Phase 3**: Add WorkOS SSO connections for enterprise customers
4. **Phase 4**: Evaluate migration to Auth0 if advanced features needed

### Decision Matrix

| Factor | Auth0 | Supabase | Cognito | Clerk | WorkOS | Recommendation |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|--------|--------|----------------|
| **Cost (100K users)** | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ | ✅ | WorkOS/Supabase |
| **Multi-tenancy** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Any top 5 |
| **Enterprise Features** | ✅ | ⚠️ | ✅ | ⚠️ | ✅ | Auth0/WorkOS |
| **Developer Experience** | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ | ✅ | ✅ | Clerk/Supabase |
| **Vendor Lock-in** | ❌ | ⚠️ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | WorkOS |
| **Scalability** | ✅ | ⚠️ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Auth0/Cognito |

## Final Recommendation

**Primary Recommendation: WorkOS + Supabase Hybrid**

1. **Authentication**: WorkOS AuthKit (free up to 1M MAU)
2. **Database**: Supabase with RLS for multi-tenancy ($25/month)
3. **Enterprise SSO**: WorkOS SSO as needed ($125/connection)

This approach provides:
- Extremely cost-effective scaling
